  <h5>Phase 4</h5>

  <p>Pressure cook (medium flame) in increments, each time checking whether the beef has become tender (I had to wait until around 15-18 whistles, checking after every 3-5 whistles). While checking after every 3-5 whistles, make sure that you turn the flame low, and let the steam settle down by itself without removing the pressure regulator (the "weight"). The Picture above was taken after the tenth whistle.</p>

  <h5>Phase 5</h5>

  <p>Once the beef has reached desired tenderness, open cook on low flame until the curry attains preferred consistency. You can even cook on low flame until barely any liquid is left behind.</p>

  <p>Transfer the curry into a bowl and garnish with coriander leaves.</p>
